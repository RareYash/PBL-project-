            Introduction to Dijkstra's Algorithm:</h1>
            <h2> Provide a brief overview of what Dijkstra's algorithm is and its significance in computer science.</h2>

<h1>History:</h1><h2> Offer a bit of background on Edsger W. Dijkstra, the Dutch computer scientist who developed the algorithm, and the context in which it was created.</h2>

<h1>Key Concepts: </h1><h2>Explain the basic concepts underlying Dijkstra's algorithm, such as graphs, vertices, edges, and shortest paths.</h2>

<h1>Algorithm Description:</h1><h2> Provide a clear and concise explanation of how Dijkstra's algorithm works, including its steps and the logic behind each step.</h2>
<h1>Applications:</h1><h2> Discuss real-world applications of Dijkstra's algorithm, such as finding the shortest path in transportation networks, computer networks, and routing algorithms.</h2>

<h1>Example: </h1><h2>Walk through a simple example of applying Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph, with visuals if possible.</h2>

<h1>Resources:</h1><h2> Provide links to additional resources for further reading or studying, such as books, academic papers, or online courses related to Dijkstra's algorithm and graph theory</h2>
